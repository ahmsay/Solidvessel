# From Zero to Prod In Minutes

To create the production environment we need:

- Servers that will be used as master and worker nodes
- A secure network configuration both between the servers and the outside world
- A Kubernetes cluster
- ArgoCD
- Microservices, databases and other applications defined as K8S resources
- DNS records to access microservices

All the components above are created **from scratch, with a single click, in minutes**.

Furthermore, by combining IaC and GitOps, we can make sure both the infrastructure and application part of the environment
stays same with the configuration we provide.
