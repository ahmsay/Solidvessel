# Solidvessel

This is a shopping application designed with microservices architecture. My main goal is to learn about
microservices, so I kept the domain part as simple as possible. The project is about recording transactions of a shopping application.

## Architecture
### Development
![development](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22731894/224532535-234a3ccc-35b3-4ece-ad92-04ae0cff13f7.svg)

In development mode, microservices are running as separate processes on your computer. Databases, RabbitMQ and Redis run
as Docker containers. Since all microservices run on the same machine, they should expose a different port. Therefore, client
must use a specific port for the corresponding microservice.

### Test
![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22731894/224534722-24fb108b-58f3-447d-af3f-cf53d3d9670a.svg)

In test mode, the whole application lives in a Kubernetes cluster which runs on your computer. Microservices, databases, Redis, and RabbitMQ now
run as deployments or statefulsets.

The communication between components is done through services (another Kubernetes
component, shown as triangles). In terms of scalability, microservices can have more than one instances, called replicas. With Kubernetes, we can easily define
a new replica for a microservice if we need more instances to distribute upcoming traffic. For example account service can have 1 replica and inventory
service can have 3 replicas. Distributing the traffic across the replicas is also done with services.

Since the purpose of the test mode is to simulate the production environment, clients
should be able to access a microservice using a single endpoint. To achieve this goal, there is another K8S component
called ingress. There are routing rules defined in ingress, and it forwards the request made by client to the corresponding 
microservice.

### Production
![prod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22731894/225763807-d85118d5-c3aa-4a37-b3b9-9ce144879e68.svg)

Production environment is logically the same with the test environment. This means that the entire application stack 
<b>still runs on a Kubernetes cluster</b>. However, the cluster is on remote servers now, just like a real world production environment. 
I used AWS as a cloud provider for this environment. <b>Please note that I'm not keeping the production environment up 7/24, that would be very costly.</b> 
Let's explain each component shown in the diagram one by one:
- **ALB**: The ingress resource we defined for the K8S cluster is converted to an ALB (Application Load Balancer). AWS
  reads
  the routing rules, services and the SSL configuration we defined in the ingress file and applies all of them in the
  ALB.
  Each ingress defined in K8S has a correspondence in ALB.
- **Target Groups**: These are subcomponents of the ALB. A target group is solely responsible for load balancing. For
  example if
  the inventory service has 3 replicas, it's the target group of the inventory service's responsibility to distribute
  the traffic across the replicas. Each Kubernetes service
  defined in the ingress file is converted to a target group on ALB.
- **Route 53**: This service is responsible for managing DNS in AWS. Each microservice has a DNS record, and they are
  forwarded through the ALB.
  When the client types a url, such as inventory.solidvessel.com , it should be resolved to the url of the ALB.
  This process is done by Route 53.
- **Private Subnet**: Giving nodes (servers) of the cluster public IP addresses poses a security risk. Anyone could see
  the nodes and
  try to exploit them. To prevent this, all servers are inside a private network, making them invisible from the outside
  world.
- **Public Subnet**: This is where servers are publicly visible. We need ALB to be public to access our application. We
  also need
  NAT Gateway to be public to give internet access to our nodes. The security of these two are handled by AWS.
- **NAT Gateway**: Since our nodes don't have a public IP address, they can't directly access to the internet. We need a
  server
  that does a network address translation (NAT), making our nodes to access the internet in a more secure way.
- **Master Nodes**: These are responsible for managing worker nodes. We don't really have any control over master nodes,
  they are fully managed by AWS.
- **Worker Nodes**: These are where our applications run. The Kubernetes cluster drawn in the test environment is
  spanned across
  the worker nodes here.
- **CloudFormation**: The whole infrastructure (nodes, subnets, ALB, NAT gateway etc.) is built on CloudFormation. This
  service
  provides a way to manage AWS resources easier using declarative approaches.
